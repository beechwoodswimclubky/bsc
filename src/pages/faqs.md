<input type="radio" id="faq1" name="rd"><label class="tab-label" for="faq1">Who owns Beechwood Swim Club?</label>
<div class="tab-content">Beechwood Swim Club is a non-profit corporation owned by its members through the issuance of bonds. The general operations of the club are overseen by a board of directors consisting of member volunteers elected by bond-holders, and the daily functions are overseen by management employed by the board.</div>
</div>

<div class="tab">
<input type="radio" id="faq2" name="rd"><label class="tab-label" for="faq2">What does it mean to be a bond-holder?</label>
<div class="tab-content">The vast majority of members at Beechwood Swim Club are bond-holders. The ownership of the swim club consists of 500 bonds issued to members by the board of directors. The bond is a one-time expense that essentially gives the bond-holder an ownership interest in the club and the ability to elect the board of directors. Once purchased, the bond remains with the holder indefinitely, as long as they remain in good standing, until they opt to transfer it to another or sell it back to the club. As a bond-holder, one commits to paying their annual membership dues or, in the alternative, an inactive fee for that season, making bond ownership a more permanent membership option than other, such as rentals.</div>
</div>

<div class="tab">
<input type="radio" id="faq3" name="rd"><label class="tab-label" for="faq3">How does someone become a bond-holder?</label>
<div class="tab-content">Bonds are available for purchase directly from the club or from bond-holders in private sales. Information about either type of purchase can be obtained by sending an inquiry to <a href="mailto:beechwoodswimclubky@gmail.com">beechwoodswimclubky@gmail.com</a></div>
</div>

<div class="tab">
<input type="radio" id="faq4" name="rd"><label class="tab-label" for="faq4">What are the annual dues for a bond-holder?</label>
<div class="tab-content">The annual dues depend on the type of membership the bond-holder chooses for the season. A breakdown of the various memberships and annual dues associated with each can be found here.</div>
</div>

<div class="tab">
<input type="radio" id="faq5" name="rd"><label class="tab-label" for="faq5">Is bond ownership required for all memberships?</label>
<div class="tab-content">There are seasonal rental membership options available that do not require the member to be a bond-holder. Information about rental memberships can be found here.</div>
</div>

<div class="tab">
<input type="radio" id="faq6" name="rd"><label class="tab-label" for="faq6">What is the duration of the club’s season, and when must membership dues be paid for the season?</label>
<div class="tab-content">Beechwood Swim Club has historically been open from Memorial Day Weekend until Labor Day. Membership dues for the 2021 season are due by April 15th. A $50 late fee will be required for membership dues not paid by April 15th. Membership dues can be paid with credit card in our member portal by logging in here \\\\\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\\\\\**. Dues can be paid by mailing a check to:

Beechwood Swim Club\
PO Box 17066\
Fort Mitchell, Kentucky 41017

Checks for membership dues that are mailed must be postmarked by April 15th to avoid the $50 late fee. Checks postmarked after April 15th must include the aforementioned fee for the member to be in good standing on opening weekend.</div>

<div class="tab-content">At this time, the board does not know if weekend reservations will be required for 2021.  If necessary, the pool will implement the same reservation system that was used in 2020.  The link to the weekend reservation site is \\\\\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\\\\\*\*.  Similar to last year, the reservation window for the following weekend will open each Monday at midnight.
