 <p style="color: #fff;">For people seeking for Beechwood Swim Club membership, we have started a new email address specifically related to our waitlist and membership inquiries. It is: <a style="color: #fff !important;" href="mailto:waitlist.beechwoodswimclub@gmail.com">waitlist.beechwoodswimclub@gmail.com</a></p>
 <p style="color: #fff;">If you have already inquired in the past, you do *not* have send one to the new address. The waitlist / bond / rental inquiries were simply overwhelming our club email address, so we needed to separate them out. </p>

## Hello Members!

<p style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">News from the Board of Directors</p>
<p>Summer is just around the corner and we are starting our pre-season work. We cannot wait for the 2025 pool season to get here!</p>
 
<p>The Board of Directors would like to welcome our newest Board Member: Stephanie Eby. Stephanie has been a life long member and is so excited to serve in her role on the board. We would also like to thank Barb Erardii for all 11 years on the board. We appreciate all she has done for us.</p>

<p>Last year the pool had significant unexpected repairs to our pool pumps. This forced us to have to close for a few days.  We are thankful to the surrounding clubs for welcoming our members to their clubs without hesitation. We appreciate everyone’s flexibility and understanding during this time.</p>

<p>Over the past several years, we have made significant investments to maintain the pool, deck, and facilities.  For 2025, the Board has committed to continuing to make improvements to the Club.  Our main focus is the pool and the pump room.  We will continue to make investments that will help our pool last for years to come.  You may have heard of other pools starting to see issues with their pool and older equipment.  We have taken pride in our proactive approach to prevent major issues. The pump breaking last year was the first major repair we have encountered in many years. We feel confident with the proactive repairs we have made over the winter season, that we are set for a successful summer.</p>

        <p>For payments after April 15th, 2025, there will be a late fee assessed of $150.00. For accounts subject to a late fee, the account will not be active until the late fee has been paid.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
 
<p style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Inactive Membership Option</p>
<p>Due to the ongoing spike in membership interest, it is important that we know how many members plan to be inactive in the 2025 season.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Members who wish to be inactive must notify the board in writing by May 15th, 2025. The inactive fee will be $350.</li>
    <li>The inactive fee must be paid by June 15th, 2025, to keep the account in good standing.</li>
    <li>Failure to notify the board of an intent to be inactive will subject you to the full membership dues for the season.</li>
    <li>Failure to pay the inactive fee by June 15th, 2025, will result in the club purchasing your bond from you at the original bond value. There is no exception to this.</li>
</ul>
 
<p style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">New Members – Bond Transfers</p>
<p>For our new members who have purchased bonds since last season, your bond must be formally transferred before your account will be active. If you need to transfer bonds, Eric Mooney will be available to meet you at the pool on the following days:</p>

<ul>
    <li>May 7th from 5–6:30pm at Beechwood Swim Club.</li>
    <li>May 14th from 5–6:30pm at Beechwood Swim Club.</li>

<p style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Member Communication Throughout the Season</p>
<p>As we head into the 2025 season, we are continuing our commitment to provide the most widespread information to our members as possible, so that everyone feels up to speed on what is happening. Issues in the past with emails have led us to try to post updates across multiple platforms including email, our pool website, and our pool Facebook page. Major items, such as our bylaws and this year’s member letter, will always be posted to our website. Please regularly check your email, our website, and our Facebook page so that you can stay informed of all events happening at the pool.</p>

<p>Job Fair</p>
<p>We had an amazing turnout at our first job fair last week. Our next job fair will be held at the Kenton County Erlanger Library on March 9th 1:30-3:30 p.m. Please see the flyer below for details. We are in need of all positions!</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">August Lifeguarding Help Needed</p>
<p>A special THANK YOU to our members Jeanne Wissman, Kristi Snyder, and Barb Erardii for all their help lifeguarding and managing so we could keep our pool open after school started back. We were the only club that did not have to reduce their hours due to their availability. We are so grateful!</p>
 
<p>We will be asking for the same help this coming year, so we do not have to reduce our hours.</p>
 
<p>To keep the pool open once  school starts back in August this year, we are asking adult members to consider getting their Lifeguard certification. Members will need to commit to 2 shifts (12-4 p.m.) per week for 2 weeks. We would need 2 people per day (Monday – Friday) starting mid-August. We are looking for a maximum of 5 volunteers.  We will hold a lifeguard certification class at the pool for those who are volunteering.</p>

<p>Please know that there is additional training on our emergency protocols at Beechwood Swim Club. Volunteers must attend those training sessions as well.</p>
